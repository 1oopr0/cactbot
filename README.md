# cactbot (Chromium ACT Bindings Overlay for Things)

## About

This project is an overlay plugin for
[RainbowMage's OverlayPlugin](https://github.com/RainbowMage/OverlayPlugin)
which itself is a plugin for
[Advanced Combat Tracker](http://advancedcombattracker.com/)

It depends on [ravahn's FFXIV ACT plugin](http://www.eq2flames.com/plugin-discussion/98088-ffxiv-arr-plugin.html).

Its goal is to provide log lines, combatant info, dps info, etc.  Everything
that anybody would need to write a good Javascript UI for
[Final Fantasy XIV](http://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/).
